**extensions are not of my authorship as you can see**  
those here are only as backup & small adjustments for custom usage  
i will put links to original repos so get there the updated ones
  

**changes**
* gnomenu maybe it's bugged and need to update manually then restart shell  
* apt-update-indicator : /media/*file*.svg is custom - *file*-O.svg is the original  
* simplenetspeed : extension.js - l143 c20 - l153 c66 - symbol changed  

> I'll keep  the full folders only on those extensions where I touched and/or are lightweight. Those empties folders are only to serve as a list of usefull extensions.

In that case an Update tab is created to easily reset the extension. A Reset button is also always present in preferences -> About Tab.\n A Default shortcut combination of Super Key + t is provided to temporarily disable the extension until GNOME Shell restarts. \n\nSome effects might not work properly on wayland, for which a workaround is provided on preferences -> Tweaks tab. \nHowever, some animations might not work properly.",
